            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Secondly, whether our Judiciall Courts of the Common Pleas, and of the Upper Bench (the former whereof handleth properly Diſputes at the Common Law; the latter, frequently, though ſometimes improperly, the like alſo;) be like to continue where they are, or not; with ſome inconveniencies hinted, if they be removed elſewhere.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166599:3"/>or will ſwear before a Juſtice in the Countrey. Now, the end of Actions ſo allowed, is, to curb mens hearts, and paſſions; who would otherwiſe quarrell every hour, and ſhed bloud. Clear enough it is, that, as to the matter of Title, what famous <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaid long agoe, is ſo <hi>Aphoriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> and indeed, to the Intelligent, perſpicuous, that very rarely (as the Learned obſerve) any of his Poſitive Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials admit of Diſpute. And if we well conſider who they are who moſt Carp at the Law; they are either, Turbulent ſpirits, pleaſed with no Government; or elſe, Vulgar heads, perhaps, men on both ſides, of ſmall eſtates, and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate. The common Law diſturbeth few of quiet ſpirits, or of low eſtates; the Vulgar hath not wherewith to work its own ruine by Law: onely there is that unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied firſt Generation, whoſe aim is to make out their own malice, by Law vexatious; a fault in themſelves, not in the Law I am ſo far from admiring, there are ſo many Enemies to the Law, that I wonder, there are no more, ſince every man deſireth his Cauſe ſhall paſſe for him: As if the Law ought not to ſpeak to all alike.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>IV</label> I ſay and will prove undeniably againſt any civill oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that our common Law (in its very naturall Bent, and conſtitution) is idoneous, fit, and adaequate rather for a Democratick government, Ariſtocratick, Annually ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Government, or Praetorian (if need be) then for a Monarchiall: becauſe it left little Arbitrarineſſe to the Kings of this Nation, which, I make a fault in that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: In the Regall times, none could be Nomotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, none could regularly provide for preſent exigencies, in the State, but by a triplicity of power in Parliament: The Judges were then, as now they are, only veſted with a Declaratory power of the Lawes <hi>Energie.</hi> Some neceſſities there are ſometimes in ſtates, abſolute, preſent, &amp; neceſſary, and theſe, men ſay, may diſpence with the very Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much more with any poſitive humane Law, for the ſafety of the People. The queſtion never was, whether we or any other people ought to be governed by an Arbytrary power (for there muſt be an Arbitrary power ſome where, elſe where will <hi>Salus populi</hi> be, at a pinch) But in whoſe hands it ought to be. What extraordinary and illegall Acts the King committed, were ſo illegall; becauſe he muſt have convented that triplicity of power to make them legall: here lay the firſt riſe of our politick quarrels; and therefore Kings muſt be, and were alwaies, at variance with the Common-Law: But now the preſent Governours <hi>(in eſſe &amp; poſſe)</hi> are and muſt be in a legall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity (and that immortally during every intervall) to act for impoſing of Taxes, raiſing the <hi>Militia, &amp;c.</hi> if you granted the King the <hi>Militia</hi> (as inherent <hi>ratione Politicae,</hi> or <hi>naturalis capacitutis</hi>) yet had he little money. The Law was not for him; it did hinder him, in the execution. But our preſent Governours, I ſay, without more adoe, do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the letter of the Law in rationally providing for the people: becauſe they are above the Law of men and (taken collectively) to thoſe ends aforeſaid; elſe we ſhould be in an hoſtile condition, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> well obſerveth. The Army is as it were neceſſitated to maintain the Law.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>V</label> And indeed their keeping upright of the Common Law, is a good Argument of the Armies putting a prudentiall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166599:4"/>difference (as to the ſacredneſſe of ſome proteſts of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Lawes of this Nation, for diſtributive Juſtice) between thoſe obligations ſome men had put unwarily upon us for preſerving the regall intereſt, contrary to the freedome of natures Law, (which ſheweth, that al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have but this to ſay (though theſe are but haſty draughts together) where the Law is defective, or redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, where the practiſe of it, is either prolix, chargeable, or uneven, where apparent disfavours are caſt upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant. In a word, where the ſame principles upon equall and adequate reaſon (the matter whereunto they are tyed being identicall) are not ſuffered or do not, but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, produce the ſame effects in Law <hi>Theorick</hi> and <hi>Pracktick</hi> where corruption is crept in, or mens cunning have ſtarted ſubter ſuges, let all ſuch excreſcencies be pared off, and with great care, leſt in one houre, more hurt come to the liberty of the ſubject, then can be repayed in an age, <hi>Nihil ſimul Natum et perfectum eſt.</hi>
